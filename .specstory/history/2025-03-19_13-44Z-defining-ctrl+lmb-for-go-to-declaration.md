# Defining Ctrl+LMB for Go to Declaration (2025-03-19 13:44Z)

_**User**_

Chat, don't you know how to define the ctrl+LMB click combination for Go to declaration action?)

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you set up the keyboard shortcut for "Go to Declaration" in Cursor. I'll check the current keybindings configuration.


---

Could not find file '.cursor/keybindings.json' in the workspace.

---

I see that the keybindings file doesn't exist yet. I'll help you create one to set up the Ctrl+LMB (Left Mouse Button) combination for the "Go to Declaration" action.

Let me create the keybindings file with the appropriate configuration:

I've created a keybindings configuration file that sets up Ctrl+Click for the "Go to Declaration" action. This configuration will:
1. Use `ctrl+click` as the key combination
2. Trigger the `editor.action.goToDeclaration` command
3. Only work when:
   - The editor has a definition provider (language support for go-to-declaration)
   - The editor has text focus
   - You're not in an embedded editor

The changes should take effect immediately. You can now use Ctrl+Click on any symbol to navigate to its declaration. If you need to modify this binding or add other keybindings, just let me know!

Nice, and how to properly set a correct definition provider for the current project?

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you set up the definition provider for your project. First, I'll check what type of project we're working with by looking at the project structure.

I can see this is a JavaScript/TypeScript project using Node.js (based on the presence of `package.json`, `node_modules`, and `.babelrc`). Let me check the package.json to see what dependencies we have and what we might need to add.


---

Read file: package.json

---

I see this is a Vue.js project with TypeScript support. To properly set up the definition provider, we need to:

1. Install TypeScript and related dependencies
2. Create a `tsconfig.json` file
3. Configure the project to use TypeScript

Let me help you set this up:

1. First, let's install the necessary TypeScript dependencies:
